          <p>
            Choosing an accountant is an important yet difficult process. You
            should ensure that you choose an accountant you feel you can work
            with on a regular basis that provides you with the level of service
            you need. Therefore, we believe the key questions that you should be
            asking are:
          </p>
          <p>Q: Should I consider changing accountants?</p>
          <p>
            A: Different accountants can approach your affairs in different
            ways, saving you tax and some will provide more advice than others.
            If you feel you are not getting the level and type of service that
            you need, then changing to us is very easy. All you will need to do
            is write one letter and we will take care of the transition. Your
            existing accountant is not usually allowed to charge you for
            providing the normal handover information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: I’ve just had my accounts done and don’t need an accountant until
            next year, so is there any need to contact you now?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: It is best to plan in advance, both from a tax perspective and to
            ensure we can take the time to properly tailor a service to suit
            your needs. Ideally you should think about tax planning before the
            year even starts.
          </p>
          <p>Q: Will you come to visit us for an initial consultation?</p>
          <p>

            to see your business first-hand, and we would be more than happy to
            invest the time to do this.
          </p>
          <p>Q: When and how soon can you come to see us?</p>
          <p>
            A: At a time that suits you. We will do our best to be flexible and
            accommodate your diary. If you need urgent assistance, let us know
            and we will do our best to see you quickly.
